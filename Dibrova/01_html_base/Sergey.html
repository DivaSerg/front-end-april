			<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. </p>
			<p> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, </p>
			<p> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type </p>
			<p> specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic </P>
			<p> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with </p>
			<p> the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with </p>
			<p> desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
